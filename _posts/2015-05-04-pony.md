I like Go very much, it's fast, natively compiled, static typed, comes with concurrency as a built-in feature at the language level, and it's not another JVM based language.

Then today I heard about new language called [Pony language](http://ponylang.org/), an [open source](https://github.com/CausalityLtd/ponyc) project developed  by [Causality](http://www.causality.io/). They claim the language is an object-oriented, actor-model, capabilities-secure, high performance programming language.

Without further ado, below is the benchmark result for the thread ring challenge between Pony and Go:

###Pony 
    time ./thread-ring -pass 50000000 -thread 503
    292
    real    0m10.936s
    user    0m21.151s
    sys 0m0.389s
 
###Golang 
    time ./go-ring -pass 50000000 -thread 503
    292
    real    0m6.909s
    user    0m6.900s
    sys 0m0.010s
